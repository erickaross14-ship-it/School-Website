# About Oracle Java Platform Extension for Visual Studio Code use of Telemetry
## First Your Privacy and Anonymity

During startup, a close event (defined below) or usage of the Oracle Java Platform extension for Visual Studio Code (hereafter referred to as "JVSCE"), Oracle does not collect or track any personally identifiable information (such as names or email addresses) about you or your source code, or associate your usage of JVSCE with personally identifiable data.

If you choose to enable telemetry collection in JVSCE, we will collect a limited set of information that is not personally identifiable. It is anonymous technical data commonly known as "telemetry". An element-by-element description of what is collected and how it helps us, [is listed below](#specifics-about-java-extension-usage-metrics).

We do not transmit your source code nor the contents of the files you edit with Visual Studio Code.

## We Collect this Data to Measure Our Own Performance, Diagnose Problems, and Improve Your Experience
The purpose of the telemetry transmitted to Oracle during the JVSCE startup, close, or usage, is to find any technical problems or anomalies that occur, so we can understand and correct them; as well as, to understand the usage of Java versions and language features, so we can help improve the platform. It's similar to a car mechanic's practice of plugging into your engine's diagnostic port to identify performance issues (not to identify the car's owner!). The issues we identify could be anything from slow performance or missing platforms for JDK builds to adoption of popular Java language capabilities. Your source code, privacy and anonymity are not compromised by our collecting this telemetry. The information thus collected helps to improve the JVSCE extension experience and the Java platform.

## If You Would Like to Enable or Disable the Collection of this Data
If you have not already made a choice for this setting, the JVSCE extension might request that you enable Telemetry via a notification pop-up at the time of activation of the extension.

If you wish to enable or disable the collection and transmission of the telemetry, you may do so from VS Code Settings &rarr; [jdk.telemetry.enabled](vscode://settings/jdk.telemetry.enabled).

No information is sent to Oracle prior to you enabling Telemetry. 

# Specifics About Java Extension Usage Metrics
## WHO Sends Information to Oracle?
We, the authors of the JVSCE, collect and send information from the Java extension, when it is running in VS Code, only for users who consent to its collection.

## HOW Is Information Sent to Oracle?
Small JSON messages are transported via a secure HTTPS connection over the Internet.

## WHEN Is Information Sent to Oracle?
Information may be sent in one or more separate messages, depending on the events reported by JVSCE.

The following types of messages may be sent if users have consented to telemetry from JVSCE:
1. Start
    - When a JVSCE instance is launched in a window, a "Start" event is sent.
    - This contains information about the version, language, architecture etc. of JVSCE, VSCode and the OS.
2. Close
    - When a JVSCE instance is closed in a window, a "Close" event is sent.
    - This contains timing information for the session.
3. Workspace Change
    - When a workspace is loaded for which JVSCE is active, a "Workspace Change" event is sent.
    - This contains information about the Java version used, build tool used, and performance times.
4. JDK Download
    - When a JDK is downloaded and installed using JVSCE, a "JDK Download" event is sent.
    - This contains information about the Java version downloaded.
5. JDK Feature
    - A "JDK Feature" event is sent when certain Java language features, such as `records`, `switch-expressions`, `pattern-matching`, etc., or functionality introduced in [JEPs](https://openjdk.org/jeps/0) is used while editing a Java file.
    - This contains information about the Java version in use and the feature names or JEP numbers used. 

## WHAT Information is Sent to Oracle?
Some or all of the following information may be sent to Oracle depending on the type of event triggered:
